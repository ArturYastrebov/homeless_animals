<p><br><br>Before you buy a dog or cat, just look at the map. It hosts many faithful friends. You will find the one to love and take care of. They are different: big, small, ready to protect you anytime, friendly, lazybones, and restless. Whenever you adopt a pet, you save the three: a pet you give home, another homeless pet that will find a vacant place in the shelter, and a Human in your heart. Adopt, donâ€™t shop, cause the true friendship is priceless! </p>
